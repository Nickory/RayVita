# RayVita: Contactless Health Monitoring & AI-Powered Wellness App (Beta)

🚀 **RayVita** is the world's first smartphone-based health monitoring app leveraging **remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)** to measure heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) using only your phone's camera. Powered by AI, RayVita delivers personalized health insights, dynamic themes, and a social community for collaborative wellness.

## 🌟 Features

- **Contactless rPPG Scan**: Measure HR and HRV with <5% Mean Absolute Error (MAE) using facial video analysis, powered by Contrast-Phys+ and 3DCNN-based spatiotemporal contrastive learning.
- **AI Health Assistant**: Daily personalized health tips and an interactive AI agent ("Little R") for tailored guidance.
- **Dynamic Visual Themes**: Over 10 Material Design-based themes (e.g., Warm Earth, Ocean Blue) with AI-generated custom themes via DeepSeek API.
- **Health History & Trends**: Visualize HR/HRV trends with weekly/monthly summaries and secure cloud sync using JWT authentication.
- **Social System**: Share health insights, post achievements, and engage in friend-based challenges.
- **Multilingual Support**: English and Simplified Chinese, with more languages planned.
- **Developer Playground**: Debug tools for theme injection, cache inspection, and force logout functionality.

## 📱 App Preview

- **Home Page**: Quick access to health data, breathing exercises, daily tips, and dynamic banners.
- **Health History**: Smooth charts for tracking physiological changes over time.
- **RayVita-Synapse**: Lightweight web hub for cross-platform data visualization and social syncing.
- **Settings**: Customize language, notifications, and themes for a personalized experience.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Mobile
- **Framework**: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + MVVM
- **Design**: Material Design principles for a sleek, responsive UI
- **Inference**: ONNX Runtime for low-latency, privacy-focused edge ML
- **Storage**: Room for local data, Retrofit for API calls

### Backend
- **APIs**: Flask REST APIs (Python) with JWT authentication
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB on Alibaba Cloud for efficient CRUD operations
- **AI Integration**: DeepSeek API for theme generation and health tips

### rPPG Technology
- **Contrast-Phys+**: Unsupervised/weakly-supervised 3DCNN model for robust HR/HRV extraction from facial videos.
- **Reference**: Sun, Z., & Li, X. (2023). *Contrast-Phys+: Unsupervised and Weakly-supervised Video-based Remote Physiological Measurement via Spatiotemporal Contrast*. IEEE T-PAMI.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- **RayVita Perpetu**: Enhanced Android model with federated learning for multi-user collaboration and personalized model fine-tuning using hardware-collected ground truth.
- **VITA Roadmap**:
  - **V**itality: Atrial fibrillation detection from facial videos.
  - **I**nsight: Real-time health data processing with advanced algorithms.
  - **T**echnology: Personalized HRV-based AI themes and exercise plans.
  - **A**ction: Emotion and stress tracking via video and computer vision.
- **Community Features**: Image posts, friend-based challenges, and expanded social feed.
- **Global Accessibility**: Additional language support for broader reach.
